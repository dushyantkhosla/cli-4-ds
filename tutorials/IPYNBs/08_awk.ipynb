    "It is a tiny, but full-featured Turing-complete **programming language** modeled on C, used to **process up to GBs of structured data**. The benefits of awk are best realized when the data has some kind of <u>structure</u>.  It extends the idea of text editing into data processing, analysis, extraction and reporting. A typical example of an awk program is one that transforms data into a formatted report, such as ingesting server log files. It extensively uses the string datatype, arrays indexed by key strings, and regular expressions.\n",

Each line is broken up into a sequence of fields, so we can think of the first word in a line as the first field, the second word as the second field, and so on. An AWK program is a sequence of pattern-action statements. AWK reads the input a line at a time. A line is scanned for each pattern in the program, and for each pattern that matches, the associated action is executed.\"*"

    "## 3 - Syntax and Execution Model\n",
    " \n",
    "An awk program consists of what we will call a **main input loop**. You don’t write this loop, it is given—it exists as the framework within which the code that you do write will be executed. The main input loop in awk is a routine that reads one line of input from a file and makes it available for processing. The actions you write to do the processing assume that there is a line of input available. In another programming language, you would have to create the main input loop as part of your program. It would have to open the input file and read one line at a time.\n",
    "\n",
    "- The main input loop is executed as many times as there are lines of input. It terminates when there is no more input to be read.\n",
    "- Inside the main input loop, your instructions are written as a series of **pattern/action** procedures. These procedures that you write will be applied to each input line, one line at a time.\n",
    "    - A **pattern** is a rule for testing the input line to determine whether or not the action should be applied to it.\n",
    "        - Usually a regex or a boolean expression used to match rows, or special expressions like BEGIN and END\n",
    "    - The **actions** can be quite complex, consisting of statements, functions, and expressions.\n",
    "        - Usually a series of awk commands applied to selected fields of rows that match the regex/where the boolean expression evaluates to True\n",
    "        - can include function calls, variable assignments, calculations, or any combination thereof.\n",
    "\n",
    "Awk allows you to write **two special routines** that can be executed before any input is read and after all input is read. These are the procedur es associated with **the BEGIN and END rules**, respectively. In other words, you can do some preprocessing before the main input loop is ever executed and you can do some post-processing after the main input loop has terminated. The BEGIN and END procedures are _optional_.\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, an awk program consists of:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **`BEGIN` segment** (optional) : to initialize our variables before we even start reading input\n",
    "- **pattern + action pairs**: to process the input data, here we may place multiple pattern + action pairs to do multiple things with the same line.\n",
    "- **`END` segment**: actions for when the EOF is reached, typically used to print results\n",
