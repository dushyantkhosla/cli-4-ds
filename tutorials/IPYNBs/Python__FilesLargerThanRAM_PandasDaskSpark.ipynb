    "\n",
    "> Apache Spark is an all-inclusive framework combining distributed computing, SQL queries, machine learning, and more that runs on the JVM and is commonly co-deployed with other Big Data frameworks like Hadoop. It was originally optimized for bulk data ingest and querying common in data engineering and business analytics but has since broadened out. Spark is typically used on small to medium sized cluster but also runs well on a single machine.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "> Dask is a **parallel programming library** that combines with the Numeric Python ecosystem to **provides parallel arrays, dataframes**, machine learning, and custom algorithms. It is based on Python and the foundational C/Fortran stack. Dask was originally designed to complement other libraries with parallelism, particular for numeric computing and advanced analytics, but has since broadened out. Dask is **typically used on a single machine**, but also runs well on a distributed cluster.\n",
    "\n",
    "> Dask is **smaller, lighter weight** than Spark. This means that it has **fewer features** and instead is intended to be **used in conjunction \n",
    "with other libraries** like Numpy and Pandas\n",
